# Churn Telco Project

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on enhancing **customer churn prediction** for a telecommunications company by leveraging **machine learning** to detect high-risk customers. By improving the accuracy of churn prediction, the model helps businesses reduce customer attrition and optimize retention strategies.  

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions  
- **Developed a predictive model** to classify customers based on churn risk, increasing early detection and customer retention efforts.  
- **Implemented multiple machine learning models**, including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM**, achieving an **AUC score of 0.85** and improving churn detection accuracy by **20%**.  
- **Visualized feature importance** using **SHAP values** to interpret model predictions and understand key drivers of customer churn.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, SHAP, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Data Processing**: PySpark for handling large datasets and performing data transformations  

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact  
âœ… **Enhanced customer churn evaluation**: Improved churn detection accuracy, reducing customer attrition.  
âœ… **Data-driven retention strategies**: Enabled targeted interventions by identifying key factors contributing to churn.  
âœ… **Scalable and automated process**: Streamlined churn prediction without manual intervention.  

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps  
ðŸ”¹ Further **model tuning** to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability.  
ðŸ”¹ **Deploying the model** as an API for real-time access via web applications.  
ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring model performance** using drift detection techniques to maintain accuracy over time.  

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10**: Ensure Python 3.10 is installed on your system.
- **UV**: Used for managing project dependencies.

## Set up virtual env 
To set up your environment variables, you need to install prerequisites python and uv 

### 2. **Install UV**

#### On macOS and Linux.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### On Windows.
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
#### With pip.
```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```
### 3. **Package Management**
We use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/) as a package management tool. Follow these steps

#### Create Virtual Environment (if not exist)
```bash
uv venv
```

### If pyproject.toml is not given or you want to modify packages
#### Create a new Python project 
```bash
uv init
```
This will create a pyproject.toml Add this text at the end of pyproject.toml in order to manage dependency in development environment.

Use uv to create a virtual environment named venv:

```bash
uv venv venv
```
#### Activate venv
Activate the virtual environment you just created:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Install requirements into a lockfile.
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```
#### Set up Juypter notebook kernel.
Run the following command to register your virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=home_credit_risk --display-name "Python (home_credit_risk)"
```
## Notebooks

- **Churn_notebook.ipynb**: Notebook that cover part 1 Data Quality & EDA and Part 2 Model prediction workflow
